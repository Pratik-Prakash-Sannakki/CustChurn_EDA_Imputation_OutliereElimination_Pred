# CustChurn_EDA_Imputation_OutliereElimination_Pred


With growth in the telecom industry and increasing competition it has become extremely difficult to offer great deals to the customer, while maintaining profits and being a strong competitor among other competitors in the industry. To do so we need to understand customer behavior and other factors which contribute to retaining customers.

Inspiration 

1.Who are the customers about to churn?

2.Which features are contributing to customer churn?


Answer the following questions:

 

* What are the data types? (Only numeric and categorical)

* Are there missing values?

* What are the likely distributions of the numeric variables?

* Which independent variables are useful to predict a target (dependent variable)? (Use at least three methods)

* Which independent variables have missing data? How much? 

* Do the training and test sets have the same data?

* In the predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?

* Which predictor variables are the most important?

* Do the ranges of the predictor variables make sense?

* What are the distributions of the predictor variables?   

* Remove outliers and keep outliers (does if have an effect of the final predictive model)?

* Remove 1%, 5%, and 10% of your data randomly and impute the values back using at least 3 imputation methods. How well did the methods recover the missing values?  That is remove some data, check the % error on residuals for numeric data and check for bias and variance of the error.

For categorical data, calculate the accuracy and a confusion matrix.
